# Java-journey

Hey there ðŸ‘‹,
This repository contains a collection of essential Java programs that I created while learning Core Java.

These codes cover many of the key concepts youâ€™ll encounter and have many basic examples which you will need when starting out â€” while they might not be enough to master Core Java completely, they can definitely help you build a solid foundation and understanding of the basics.

I originally coded these during my course, and at the moment, I donâ€™t plan to add more examples. However, I might update or expand this repository in the future.

Feel free to experiment with the code! ðŸš€

PS: I will be making this repo more readable.
